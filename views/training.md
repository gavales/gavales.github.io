# Flight Training

<div id="mycard" class="grid">
<div style="padding:1rem">

There are many facets to flight training. The Victoria Flying Club staff would be delighted to show you how
they fit together. The staff at Victoria Flying Club works with you to develop a training program that will
help you reach any of your flying goals. We've been doing this since shortly after the Wright Brothers lifted
off the ground at Kitty Hawk!

Some people want to fly just for the fun of it. Others want a career in aviation. The Victoria Flying Club is
your doorstep into the wonderful world of flying, no matter which path you want to follow. Members of our club
have become Astronauts, Airline Pilots, Aerobatic Performers, Bush Pilots, Military Aviators, and more often
than not, just really good pilots who fly around Canada and the USA because there is nothing else like it.

## Getting Started
### Go for a Discovery Flight

If you're still indecisive about whether flying an aircraft or flight training is for you, you may want to
start your journey with a _Discovery Flight_. During this flight you will get to _actually_ fly
and control
one of our training aircraft. Don't worry, you would be accompanied by a qualified flight instructor so that
they can teach you how the controls work and what they do to the aircraft.

Since these flights are treated exactly like a flight lesson, they are also priced like one. Using our
<a>rates</a> you can budget for the flight assuming 1 hour on our Cessna Training Fleet aircraft and 1.5 hours
of Flight Instructor time.

### Get a Medical Certificate

In accordance with the CARs licensing requirements, you need a medical certificate to not only obtain a pilot
license, but to maintain one. So once you've made your decision to become a pilot, your next step should be to
complete an aviation medical exam.

### Sign Up!

Your final steps to getting started will be to:

- Register at a Flight Training Unit
  - _[Become a VFC member](https://flyvfc.com/apply-today)_
- Enroll on a flight training course
  - _Settle our course application Fee, and complete the student contract_
- Start attending a ground school
  - _Settle the ground school fee, and call us to enroll._

## Requirements

### Knowledge, Skill & Experience

Most licenses/ratings/permits will require completion of a Transport Canada written examination, as well as a
flight test (after completing a certain amount of flight time) before you are able to obtain a license.
Transport Canada produces guides for all written examinations and flight tests, which can be found in their
list of [Aviation Publications](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/publications).

Each license has different requirements for flight time. It is important to understand that these are
_minimums_. Most students will require more than the minimums. However, the more frequently you fly the
more efficient your training will be and less flight time is needed to reach the standards to pass the flight
test.

For detailed information about the requirements for all licenses, permits, or ratings (_and all other
regulations_) always refer to the
[Canadian Aviation Regulations](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-96-433/FullText.html).
Refer specifically to [CARs Standard 421 - Flight Crew Permits, Licences and Ratings](https://tc.canada.ca/en/corporate-services/acts-regulations/list-regulations/canadian-aviation-regulations-sor-96-433/standards/standard-421-flight-crew-permits-licences-ratings-canadian-aviation-regulations-cars).
</div>

<div style="padding:1rem">

### Medical Fitness
To hold a pilot license, and to keep it valid, you must take regular medical examinations with a Civil
Aviation Medical Examiner (CAME), at varying levels (the medical categories in the above table). Given that,
once you make your decision to begin flight training, your first step should be to take a medical examination.

See [CAR 404.04 (6)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-96-433/FullText.html#h-991054)
for a description of the validity period for each medical category and see [this section](#medical-exam) for a list of CAMEs.

### Age
You must be 14 to _hold_ a Student Pilot Permit, 16 to _hold_ a Recreational Pilot Permit, 17 to
_hold_ a Private Pilot Licence, and 18 to _hold_ a Commercial Pilot License. You can start
_learning_ to fly (with a qualified instructor) at any age as long as you can safely control the
aircraft you will train on.

However, you will not be able to fly your first solo flight, and begin to obtain any 'solo' flight time until
you are 14 years old and can obtain an SPP.

## Ground School

A big part of learning to fly is understanding how your aircraft works and how it responds to your control
inputs, as well as the procedures for the airspace in which you will fly. Most of this is learned during the
in-air portion of the flight training, but not everything can be, so Transport Canada requires that aspiring
pilots obtain the necessary information about all other aspects of flying before they can become
_licensed_ pilots.

To help students gain that information, at VFC we offer Transport Canada-approved ground school classes as
part of our RPP, PPL, and CPL courses, administered by our dedicated ground school instructor, Neil Keating.
For information about these courses, and to enroll, [please contact him](tel:+12042919667). The RPP/PPL ground school runs on Saturdays and Sundays, from 09:00 to 16:00, on a ten-week cycle,
and can be attended in-person or online.

</div>

<div style="padding:1rem">

It begins with learning about the _Licensing Requirements_, followed closely by
sessions on _Aerodynamics & Theory of Flight_ and _Airframes, Engines, Systems
& Instruments_ - a deeper dive into how a variety of aircraft work, including
their main systems and instruments/avionics.

Then the _Canadian Aviation Regulations_ are covered, focussing on _Air Law &
Procedures_ and _Flight Operations_ - learning the rules of the air, and how
they affect all aspects of your flights to effect safety in aviation.

The knowledge of aircraft _Navigation_ and aviation _Meteorology_ (the weather,
and the tools available to pilots to help forecast meteorological conditions)
will help students to _actually_ navigate an aircraft safely on cross-country
flights during the latter parts of their PPL and CPL training.

Finally, all this information is tied together with discussions on the effect of
a pilot's decision making on aviation. Knowing a variety of _Human Factors_ will
help you to predict how your personality can affect your own aviating. Through
your flight training, you would eventually learn how to use this knowledge to
_apply good pilot decision making_.

## Private Pilot License
To hold a Private Pilot License, you must be 17 years of age and possess a Category 3 Medical Certificate or
higher. This licence allows you to fly all single engine, non-high-performance aircraft during daylight hours
under VFR.

A minimum of 40 hours ground school classes must be taken (VFC's is 48 hours), as well as 10 hours of flight
time, before candidates can write the written exam (the PPAER). The topics to be covered can be found in the
written exam guide.

The flight training is a minimum 45 hours of flight time, consisting of not less than:
- 17 hours of dual training, including;
  - 3 hours to be acquired during cross country flight.
  - 5 hours instrument flying (a maximum of 3 can be obtained on a Flight Training Device, FTD).
- 12 hours of solo flight time, including;
  - 5 hours cross country flight time.
  - A cross country flight of not less than 150 nautical miles from the point of departure and including 2
    landings at aerodromes other than the point of departure.

> The length of the course will not only depend on how well you prepare for each flight, but also on how often
> you fly. Most students find a pace of 2-3 flights a week to be the sweet spot, and can complete their PPL
> training in about 6 to 12 months. More time between flights means more skill deterioration, so being able to
> fly more often will adjust how much flight time you need, and, perhaps, how expensive your training will be.

Most people need an average of 55 hrs of flight time, which the below estimate is based on.

## Night Rating

A pilot endorsed with a Night Rating can fly during the night in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) under
VFR. Its requirements are described in
[CAR Standard 421.42](https://tc.canada.ca/en/corporate-services/acts-regulations/list-regulations/canadian-aviation-regulations-sor-96-433/standards/standard-421-flight-crew-permits-licences-ratings-canadian-aviation-regulations-cars#421_42).</a>

Any instrument time obtained during your PPL training will count towards the 10 hours of instrument time
required for this rating.\

## Mountain Awareness Course

After completing their PPL training, an inexperienced pilot may be eager to explore all of BC. However, in the
Pacific Region, the combined effect of the great mountain ranges and the adjacent Pacific Ocean lead to varied
and unfamiliar meteorological conditions. To an unprepared pilot, flying a light, underpowered aircraft like
ours, these conditions can produce a hazardous flying environment.

Thus, VFC requires that our pilots complete a _Mountain Awareness Course_ designed to provide them with
sufficient knowledge and skills to fly safely in mountainous terrain.

## Commercial Pilot License

[Privileges](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-96-433/page-38.html#h-990565) ···
[Flight Test Guide](https://tc.canada.ca/node/29065) ···
[Written Exam Guide](https://tc.canada.ca/node/28878)

The ground school will cover all the same topics as the PPL ground school, but in much more detail and you
will also need to fly more difficult exercises, to a higher standard for the flight test. So, be prepared for
a more detailed and disciplined approach to your studying.

A total of 200 hours of flight time is required for this license with 100 PIC,
and all the flight time earned from any prior training (for the PPL, for
example) will count towards this total.

However, a total of 65 hours of training specifically for the CPL license is required, which will include only
flight time gained after the PPL license:

- 35 hours of dual training, including:
  - 5 hours cross country flight time
  - 5 hours night flying, 2 hours during cross country flight
  - 20 hours of instrument flight time, 10 of which may be obtained on an FTD
    - This does not include any earned from the PPL training.
- 30 hours of solo flight:
  - A Cross country flight of at least 300 nautical miles, as the crow flies, from the point of
    departure, planned and flown using the skills learned from our _Mountain Awareness Course_.
  - 5 hours night flying
  At VFC, these 30 hours have to be on one of our Cessna Training Aircraft, which
  have been commercially registered flight training

## Multi-Engine Rating

[Flight Test Guide](https://tc.canada.ca/node/29593)
A pilot endorsed with a Multi-engine Rating can fly aircraft with more than one engine. It has no minimum
flight time requirements, so the training involves flying with your instructor until you reach flight test
standard.

The candidate must pass a flight test that shows their proficiency in all multi-engine manoeuvres and
emergency procedures.

The average candidate needs approximately 12 hours of flight time.

> With the appropriate amount of self-preparation and study, it can be
> possible to complete the Multi-engine & Instrument ratings before earning
> the CPL, but although there is no CARs requirement for it, VFC requires that
> our MIFR candidates obtain their CPL first.
> 
> The CPL training will help to improve and cement your basic flying skills, as well as your discipline for
> self-study. We have found that this gives our students the necessary knowledge and professional skills the
> Multi-engine & Group 1 Instrument Rating require. If a student does not have this foundation, they may end
> up requiring roughly 30% more flight time to complete these ratings.

# Instrument Rating

> [Privileges](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-96-433/page-38.html#h-990688) ···
> [Flight Test Guide](https://tc.canada.ca/node/30469) ···
> [Written Exam Guide](https://tc.canada.ca/node/30447) 

A pilot endorsed with an Instrument Rating can fly an aircraft in Instrument
Meteorological Conditions (IMC) under Instrument flight Rules (IFR).

After completing the _INRAT written exam_, the flight training will consist of 40 hours of instrument
time (maximum of 20 hours in an FTD). All the instrument time you earned during the CPL training will
contribute to this requirement, and at least 5 hours of dual flight time is required on the category of
aircraft you wish to get the rating for.

You also need 50 hours of cross country PIC time, which you will probably obtain during your CPL
time-building.

No ground school is required to take the written exam and VFC does not currently run one, so you may want to
use an online one like Harv's Air's <a href="https://www.pilottraining.ca/index.php">pilottraining.ca</a> or
<a href="https://courses.inratexamprep.com/">INRATExamPrep.com</a> to help you study.

Costs for the Instrument Rating will vary depending on your experience (most people require more than the 40
hours instrument time) and the aircraft type chosen for the rating. You can do a single engine (Group 3)
instrument rating on one of our Cessna Training Aircraft. A multi-engine (Group 1) instrument rating can be
completed on our Piper Seminole.

_This estimate is based on the requirements in CAR Standard 421.46, and assumes a candidate has flown,
during their CPL training, 20 hrs of instrument time (including 10 hrs of simulated instrument time)_

[Flight Test Guide](https://tc.canada.ca/node/30590) ···
[Written Exam Guide](https://tc.canada.ca/node/24788) 

A pilot endorsed with an Instructor Rating can teach others to fly.
The training can only be started after you have completed the Commercial
Pilot Licence. A Class 1 Flight Instructor will administer:

- 25 hours ground school
  - students may want to supplement VFC's in-house ground school using another FTU's, for example
    [pilottraining.ca](https://www.pilottraining.ca/index.php)
- 30 hours dual flight training, specifically for the rating.
  - 5 of which must be dedicated towards teaching instrument flying skills, and which can be on
    an approved Flight Training Device.

> There is no solo time requirement for the instructor rating, but it is strongly recommended that the candidate
> use some PIC flight time to help refine their teaching skills in the air.

After completing the ground school, as well as 15 hours of flight time, a candidate is eligible to challenge
the AIRAF Written Examination. Once all the required flight training is completed (for example the minimum
ground school and flight time), the candidate may attempt the flight test with a Transport Canada Examiner.

> Since you will be _learning_ how to teach, you will be expected to spend
> about 250 hours of your own time developing lesson plans (also known as
> Preparatory Ground Instruction, "PGIs") and refining your
> instructional techniques. All this will be done with help from
> [TP-975 Flight Instructor Guide](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/publications/flight-instructor-guide-aeroplane-tp-975)
> as well as your instructor, who will demonstrate these PGIs.
