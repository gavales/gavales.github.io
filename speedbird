I've always been a technically minded person, which is partly responsible for my choice of courses at secondary school, college, and university. Taking apart computers remote controlled toys and understanding how they work is something that I did when I was younger, and still do today with FPV quadcopters.

Things that fly interested me particularly, so I decided to learn Aeronautical Engineering at university. University taught me how to study effectively, and helped me understand how aircraft work, sometimes by designing autonomous aircraft from scratch, and other times by learning the aerodynamic theory, of hypersonic airflow or orbital mechanics for example. I started building remote controlled quadcopters at university in fact, and it was this that made me realise I very much enjoy controlling aircraft. After going to a small talk from a pilot, it only made me more curious about becoming a pilot.

Once I finished Uni, bush flying, especially on floats, was something that excited me, hence why I went to Canada, which still has a relatively large industry for light general aviation aircraft.
